## 1. Lambda Expression 

To create a lambda expression, we specify input parameters (if there are any) on the left side of the lambda operator ->, and place the expression or block of statements on the right side of lambda operator. For example, the lambda expression (x, y) -> x + y specifies that lambda expression takes two arguments x and y and returns the sum of these.
